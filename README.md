# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to do QA of the five given data tables, which include practices such as normalization and intepretation. At the end of the project, I want to present to my audience as if they are my business partners, for example, I would explain what I have found and give advise on what to improve in the future.

## Process
Step one: I started with the five given questions, because other than starring at the tables and think about what to do as a complete beginner, it would be easier for me to tackle the technical questions first. 

Step two: After solving the five questions, I started to notice the issues, and then I went back to the basics of QA practices. I felt much easier doing that since I have already tackled the harder portion of this project. Some of the columns are too empty to tell a story, for example, in the first question, I was required to find the transaction value and trend of orders and products from certain areas. However, I noticed that many of the transactions with orderIDS had zero revenue. Therefore, I moved to the TotalTransactionRevenue column and used that one instead. 

Step three:

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
Day 1-2:
As complete beginner, I was stupid enough to forget everything I learned in the PrepCourse and did not realize that part of the requirements are right here on Github. Therefore, without the tutorials and guidelines, I thought I had to do this completely out of scratch and I spent two full days trying to port in the five data tables. I manually inserted columns to tables, one by one using sql queries. Overall, it was not a waste of time, because I learned to clean the data format on Excel, and mastered the "INSERT" and some other clauses in postgresql. 

Day 3-4:
I realized that I am more confused than the table than learning to code. I had to Google some of the columns to find out the meanings, for example, the sentimentscores and ratio. Luckily, this project is supposed to be challenging for us to not have enough time, or else I would defenitely dig in deeper because I got annoyed by the fact that I had to analyze a set of data which I knew nothing of - I would have to practice in the future as well, since this would be my new norm.


## Future Goals
As mentioned above, I would defenitely spend more time starring at the data, and research related topics on the eCommerce business,
